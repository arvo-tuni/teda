This folder should contain tests data. For each Python log file, create a new folder in this folder and place this Python log there, as well as the corresponding Tobii Studio file(s). 

Then this folder may look like this:
<pre>
data
├─test1
│ ├─testResults.txt
│ └─eyemovements.tsv
└─test2
  ├─testResults.txt
  └─eyemovements.tsv
</pre>
